This is a great idea, especially for developers who want to understand a codebase quickly. Let's break this down into key components and explore areas for improvement:

### **Core Components**
1. **GitHub Repo Ingestion**  
   - Clone the repository or fetch its content via GitHub API.  
   - Parse the file structure and display it in a tree view.  

2. **Frontend (UI/UX)**
   - A **code viewer** (read-only) with syntax highlighting.  
   - A **tree structure** displaying the repo files.  
   - A **chatbot interface** where users can ask questions.  
   - **Highlighting & context selection** (users highlight code and ask about it).  

3. **Backend (Processing & Retrieval)**
   - **Code Understanding Engine**  
     - Extracts functions, classes, dependencies, and relationships.  
   - **Chunking & Retrieval**  
     - When a user asks a question, the bot identifies relevant files/functions.  
     - Uses embeddings & similarity search to fetch related code.  
   - **LLM Processing**  
     - Uses an LLM (GPT-4o-mini or another model) to answer queries based on retrieved context.  
   - **Memory & Context Awareness**  
     - Maintains conversation state across interactions.  

4. **Enhancements & Areas for Improvement**
   - **Dependency Mapping**: Show related files when asking about a function.  
   - **Auto-Generated Summaries**: Provide explanations for files/classes automatically.  
   - **Interactive Flow**: Suggest follow-up questions or guide exploration.  
   - **Multi-Repo Support**: Ability to compare implementations across different repos.
